# Siteimprove CMS Add-On for Episerver 

The Siteimprove CMS Add-On bridges the gap between the Episerver content management system (CMS) and the Siteimprove Intelligence Platform. With this seamless integration, your team can fix errors and optimize content directly within the Episerver editing environment. Once the detected issues have been assessed, you can re-check the relevant page in real-time and assess if further actions are needed.

The Siteimprove CMS Add-On provides insights into*:
* Misspellings and broken links
* Readability levels
* Accessibility issues (A, AA, AAA conformance level)
* High-priority policies
* SEO: technical, content, UX, and mobile 
* Page visits and page views
* Feedback rating and comments

*Data shown in the Siteimprove CMS Add-On depends on the Siteimprove services you are subscribed to.
